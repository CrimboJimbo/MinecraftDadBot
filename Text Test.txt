[allay] {I don't know what they do, but I've seen them caged up by pillagers and they seem really grabby.}
[armadillo] {They're small armored fellas that like warm places. Saw one eat a spider eye once.}
[axolotl] {Colorful little things. They stay underground and like to swim. You could probably fit one in a bucket.}
[bat] {Noisy little critters. Like dark places, especially caves}
[camel] {They're a popular ride in the desert with enough room for two. Seem to like cacti}
[cat] {Never saw it myself, but people keep them as pets. Like fish, I think.}
[chicken] {You'll find them anywhere there's grass and they eat seeds. Taste pretty good and you could probably use its eggs and feathers for something.}
[chickern] {Prometheus was punished by the gods for giving the gift of knowledge to man. He was cast into the bowels of the earth and pecked by birds}
[cod] {They are a fish that can be found in the ocean, as long as it's not too warm.}
[cow] {You'll find them anywhere there's grass to eat. Good for food, leather, and milk. Not to be confused with Cod.}
[donkey] {Kinda like horses. They like wide-open spaces and are half of the matchup that makes mules. They'll eat just about anything any other livestock eats.}
[frog] {Jumpy fellas. Like swampy places and eating slimes. I saw one vomit a glowing thing after eating a warm-lookin' slime.}
[glow_squid] {Squids that make their own light when there isn't any.}
[horse] {Like wide-open spaces. They like apples and are pretty nice rides. Half of the matchup to make a mule.}
[mooshroom] {Like cows, but covered in mushrooms, probably because they are around them so much. Never seen one, but I've always wondered if they make something other than milk.}
[mule] {Child of a donkey and a horse and can't be bred. Good for carrying things.}
[ocelot] {Like a wild jungle cat. Not exactly a house pet, but they'll stick around if fed.}
[parrot] {Bird of the jungle. They'll imitate any noise and can be your pet for some seeds.}
[pig] {They're anywhere where there's grass, really only good for food, but you could lead them on with a carrot for laughs.}
[pufferfish] {You'll find them in oceans as long as it's not too cold. They're poisonous to the touch if they're upset.}
[rabbit] {They like colder and hot climates, but not temperate ones. Can be eaten, but there's not enough of them to really do much good.}
[salmon] {They stick around in colder oceans, but make their way into the rivers occasionally. Can be eaten if you care to get enough of them.}
[iron_golem] {Iron is gay af lkamo}
[gold_golem] {that shit ain't real cuz}
