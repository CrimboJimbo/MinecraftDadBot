# DadBot
A Lua Chat Bot script for CCTweaked and Advanced Peripherals!

---

DadBot is a simple Lua script for the Minecraft mods [CCTweaked](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked) and [Advanced Peripherals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-peripherals).

The plan is simple, A chat-based bot that acts like a Dad!
This is by no means an original idea, as there are simmilar bots for discord and even a Minecraft mod that tells jokes when you connect to a server.
Our bot wants to take these concepts and both expand apon the idea, and also make it easy to upload to any modded server with these two mods installed.
